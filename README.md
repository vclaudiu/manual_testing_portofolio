The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Application under test: [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers)

API Documentation:[https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md](url)

The final project will be split into 2 sections: Testing section and SQL section.

Tools used: JIRA,Postman, MySQL Workbench

**Functional specifications**
Work Shifts
Job Categories Module
Employment Status Module
Pay grade Module
Job Titles

**1 Testing section**
1.1 Test Planning
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the Admin module/Job section from the OrangeHRM application.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and person allocated: Claudiu Vranceanu
1.1.2 Entry criteria defined:Existing the application , Access to Orange HRM-valid Admin account, Employee list needs to be created under PIM Module 
1.1.3 Exit criteria defined
1.1.4 Test scope
Tests in scope:Admin/Job Module with Job Titles, Pay Grades, Employment Status, Job Categories, Work Shifts
Tests not in scope: Other Modules/Functionality.

1.1.5 Risks detected
Project risks:Imposibility to fix all bugs,unexperienced tester
Product risks:posibility for the application to not work constant
1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria
The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

1.2 Test Monitoring and Control
It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.

1.3 Test Analysis
The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Dependents module. The following test conditions were found:
Testing Admin/Job Module with Subcategories: Job Titles, Pay Grades, Employment Status, Job Categories, Work Shifts
1.4 Test Design
Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:
The test cases with steps can be viewed here: [Test cases.pdf](https://github.com/vclaudiu/manual_testing_portofolio/files/11330880/Test.cases.pdf)
1.5 Test Implementation
The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:
-Preparing test data and ensuring it is correct : test conditions, test cases, test procedures, and test suites

1.6 Test Execution
Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary:[Cycle summary.pdf](https://github.com/vclaudiu/manual_testing_portofolio/files/11331077/Cycle.summary.pdf)
Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: created_bugs.pdf
